I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/mseen/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Information Systems. I'm very fortunate to work with [Prof. Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/), [Prof. Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/), [Prof. Zijie Zhou](https://sites.mit.edu/zijiezhou/), [Prof. Jinglong Zhao](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jinglong-zhao/) and [Prof. David Simchi-Levi](https://slevi1.mit.edu/) during my undergraduate study. 
**I'm seeking a Ph.D. position in 2026 fall!** <br/> 
## Research Interest
I am broadly interested in the science of decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on developing principled, data-driven methods that are both theoretically sound and practically impactful. My goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of how learning, optimization, and inference can be integrated to support robust decision-making in dynamic and information-constrained environments. In the long run, I hope to help bridge the gap between elegant theory and real-world relevanceâ€”building tools that are not only provable in performance, but also meaningful in application.
