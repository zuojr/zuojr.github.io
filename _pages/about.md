I'm a junior undergraduate at [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/mseen/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Information Management and Information Systems. I'm fortunate to work with [Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/), [Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/), [Zijie Zhou](https://sites.mit.edu/zijiezhou/) and [Jinglong Zhao](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jinglong-zhao/). <br/>
I'm seeking a phd position in [Operation Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management)&[Operation Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) in 2026 fall. <br/> 
## Research Interest
I am thrilled by online learning, experimental design, hoping to develop novel data-driven methods that can be used to solve real-world challenges. <br/>
