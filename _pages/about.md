I am an undergraduate student in the [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/mseen/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and I am applying for PhD programs in OR/OM starting Fall 2026.

My research interests broadly lie in data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, at the intersection of online learning, causal inference, and generative models. I am especially excited about settings where rigorous theory meets realistic data and constraints, such as pricing, recommendation and decision-making in modern financial platforms.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bo Li](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/6985.htm) on my undergraduate thesis on structured generative models for causal inference. I have also been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/) and [Prof. Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/) on multi-armed bandits, and with [Prof. Zijie Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/zijiezhou/) and [Prof. Jinglong Zhao](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jinglong-zhao/) on experimental design for online scheduling.<br/>

## Research Interest
**Methodology:** online learning, causal inference, generative models.  
**Applications:** dynamic pricing, online recommendation, financial platforms.


## Miscs
I enjoy table tennis, basketball and travelling in my free time.
