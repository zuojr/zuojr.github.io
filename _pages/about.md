I'm a third-year undergraduate student at [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/mseen/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Information Management and Information Systems. I'm very fortunate to work with [Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/), [Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/), [Zijie Zhou](https://sites.mit.edu/zijiezhou/) and [Jinglong Zhao](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/jinglong-zhao/) during my undergraduate study. <br/>
**I'm seeking a phd position in 2026 fall!** <br/> 
## Research Interest
My research insterests include data-driven decision-making, stochastic modeling and their potential intersection with LLM. Especially, I am thrilled by online learning, queuing theory and experimental design, hoping to develop novel methods that can be used to solve real-world challenges. <br/>
