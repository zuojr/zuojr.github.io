I'm currently doing research st [Vanke School of Public Health](https://vsph.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), fortunately having [Prof.John S.Ji](https://vsph.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1041.htm) as my research advisor. I will be an exchange student at [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in 2024 fall.

## Interest
I am thrilled by causal inference, operation research and data-driven decision-making, hoping to develop novel methods that can be used to solve real-world challenges especially in public health and improve social welfare. And I wish to pursue a doctoral degree in the future. Here is my [CV](CV_zuojr.pdf)<br/>
