*Welcome here!*<br/>
I'm an undergraduate at [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Information Management and Information Systems at [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/mseen/) and minoring in Statistical Science at [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I'm currently doing research in the intersection of machine learning and optimization, fortunately having [Prof.Qin Hanzhang](https://hanzhangqin.com/) as my research advisor. Currently I'm an exchange student at [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).<br/>

## Research 
I am thrilled by causal inference, operation research and data-driven decision-making, hoping to develop novel methods that can be used to solve real-world challenges and improve social welfare. And I wish to pursue a doctoral degree in the future. <br/>
