Really excited to meet Jim Dai Again! And also other great scholars including [David Simchi-Levi](https://slevi1-mit-edu.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au), [Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/), [Haizhou Li](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/498), [Jeff Wu](https://research.gatech.edu/people/jeff-wu), etc. I love the campus of CUHK SZ and the OR environment there.

## [Mostly OM 2024](http://www.rccm.tsinghua.edu.cn/mostly_om/home.htm)
Mostly OM 2024 is the start of my academic journey.<br/>
Thanks to the recommendation of [Prof.Bo Li](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1233/6986.htm), I was lucky to be enrolled in this great workshop as an undergraduate, which was my very first time attending an OM academic workshop. I met some great scholars in OM/OR/Stat including [Prof.CHEN Jian](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/7004.htm), [Prof. David D.Yao](http://www.columbia.edu/~yao/), [Prof. Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/), [Prof. Zizhuo Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/), and [Prof. Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/) who later became my first advisor in this area. Also I made some friends who had similar interest in this area.
